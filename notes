Encapsulation -> Core pillar of OOPS
- concept of datawrapping
- restricts direct access to prevent variables from being altered 

HOW DOES IT WORK:
Private variables: 
- not open to globalspace
- cannot access functions directly
- accessible through modification of a function or through public functions (can store these priv variables)

SYNTAX for private variables:
ex:
    def __init__(self,name): #constructor
        self.__c=30 **PRIVATE variable

HOW TO CALL:
    def public_method(self): **Stores private variable
        print(self.__c)
